# Performance Testing – Overview and Acceptance Criteria

To evaluate the performance of the **EUDI Wallet application** under average user load, mobile performance testing will be conducted across a variety of mobile devices.  
This testing will focus on **CPU and memory usage**, as well as **network activity** during common user scenarios.

The goal is to ensure that the application performs efficiently, remains stable under expected workloads, and provides a consistent user experience across devices and conditions.  
The following acceptance criteria define the minimum expected standards for system performance during testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
The following acceptance criteria will be applied for the different test scenarios.

| **Criteria** | **Notes** |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Response Time** | 1.6 – 2.0 seconds |
| **CPU / Memory Usage** | Must not exceed 40% CPU utilization and 250 MB of memory on any device |
| **App Stability (No Crashes)** | No crashes or unexpected terminations during testing |

## Notes
- These thresholds are based on baseline performance expectations for average user load conditions.
- Any deviation beyond these limits should be analyzed and documented, with recommendations for optimization.
