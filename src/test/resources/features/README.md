## Test Case Documentation

At the top level, the repository is divided into two main categories: iOS and Android. Each of these folders contains subfolders for different epics, named exactly as they appear on GitHub.

Inside each epic folder, there is a README file summarizing which user stories (US) belong to that specific epic. This helps maintain traceability between high-level features and their implementation details.
Each epic folder also contains subfolders named after the user stories. Within each user story folder, you will find the feature files that define the test cases related to that story.



For more detailed information about the testing process, and setup instructions, please refer to the [main](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-testing-application-internal/blob/main/README.md) readme file.
