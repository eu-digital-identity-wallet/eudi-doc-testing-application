  Feature: EUDI Wallet User Views PID Presentation History for "Sign Document" Operations
    As a EUDI Wallet User,
    I want to view the history of the PID presentations associated with the “sign document” operation
    so that I am informed on when and which documents I have signed using my EUDI Wallet
